Through us rains descend and through us mercy is spread and the blessings of the earth come out. Had there not been (an Imam) from us in the earth, it would have been destroyed.</i>” <br>Then Imam (a.s.) continues, “<i>Since Allah has created Adam (a.s.), the earth is not devoid of a proof from Allah; regardless of him being apparent and known or hidden and concealed. It cannot be devoid of a proof from Allah till the Day of Judgment. Had this not been the case, Allah would not have been worshipped.</i>”<br>Sulaiman says, “I asked al-Sadeq (a.s.), ‘How can the people benefit from an Imam who is hidden and concealed?” <br>He (a.s.) replied, “<i>Like they benefit from the sun when the clouds conceal it.</i>”",

    "english": "Ali Ibn Ibraheem narrates from his father who in turn narrates from al-Hasan Ibn Ibraheem from Yunus Ibn Yaqoob who reports, “A group of companions of Imam Abu Abdillah (al-Sadeq a.s.) were with him. From them were Humraan Ibn A’yan, Muhammad Ibn al-No’maan, Heshaam Ibn Saalem, al-Tayyaar and a group from whom was a young man Heshaam Ibn al-Hakam. Imam al-Sadeq (a.s.) told him, ‘<i>O Heshaam! Will you not inform me how you dealt with Amr Ibn Obaid and how you questioned him?</i>’ Heshaam replied, ‘O son of Allah’s Messenger! I hold you in awe, feel shy in front of you and become tongue-tied.’ Imam (a.s.) retorted, ‘<i>When I order you something, then do it.</i>’ <br>Heshaam said, ‘I heard about the beliefs of Amr Ibn Obaid and his gatherings in the Mosque of Basrah. It was difficult for me to bear this. Hence, I set out for him and reached Basrah on Friday. I came to the Mosque of Basrah and saw a huge circle in which was Amr Ibn Obaid, donning black cloak of wool and another robe over it. People were asking him questions. I made my way through the people and sat at the end of the circle on my knees. <br>Thereafter, I asked him, ‘O learned man! I am a stranger. If you permit, can I ask something?’ <br>He told me, ‘Yes’. <br>I questioned him, ‘Do you have eyes?’ <br>He shot back,’O son! What sort of a question is this? How can you ask about something which you are seeing with your eyes? <br>I said, ‘My question is such.’ <br>He said, ‘Son, ask, even if your question is foolish.’ <br>I said, ‘Answer me about it.’ <br>He reiterated, ‘Ask.’<br>I asked, ‘Do you have eyes?’<br>He replied, ‘Yes.’<br>I asked, ‘What do you do with them?’<br>He answered, ‘I see colours and persons through them.’<br>I asked, ‘Do you have a nose?’<br>He replied, ‘Yes.’<br>I asked, ‘What do you do with it?’<br>He answered, ‘I smell fragrances with it.’<br>I inquired, ‘Do you have a mouth?’<br>He responded, ‘Yes.’<br>I questioned, ‘What do you do with it?<br>He replied, ‘I taste foods with it.’<br>I asked, ‘Do you have ears?’<br>He answered, ‘Yes.’<br>I inquired, ‘What do you do with them?’<br>He responded, ‘I hear sounds with them.’ <br>I questioned, ‘Do you have intellect?’ <br>He replied in the affirmative. <br>I asked, ‘What do you do with it?’<br>He answered, ‘Through it I distinguish whatever occurs to my limbs and senses.’ <br>I questioned, ‘Are not these limbs needless of the intellect?’<br>He responded in the negative. <br>I inquired, ‘How is this possible while these limbs are healthy and safe?’<br>He argued, ‘Son! When the limbs doubt about anything that they smell, see, taste or hear, they refer it to the intellect, seeking certainty and dispelling the doubt.’ <br>I took confirmation, ‘It means the presence of the intellect is necessary otherwise the limbs cannot gain certainty.’<br>He reaffirmed.<br>I reasoned, ‘O Aba Marwan! So Allah has not left your limbs without a leader who will verify for them the correct things and grant certainty to them in things they doubt. But has left this entire creation in their perplexity, doubt and disagreements, without appointing a leader for them to whom they can refer in their doubts and confusions, yet He has left a leader for you for your limbs to whom you can refer in your confusions and doubts.’<br>He kept silent and did not say anything to me. Thereafter, he turned to me and asked, ‘Are you Heshaam Ibn al-Hakam?’ <br>(Praciticing dissimulation) I denied.<br>He questioned again, ‘Are you from his colleauges?’<br>Again, I refuted.<br>He asked, ‘From where are you?’<br>I replied, ‘I am a resident of Kufa.’<br>He said, ‘Then you are certaintly him (viz. Heshaam).’ Saying this, he embraced me, made me sit in his seat and moved away from it. He did not utter a word till I stood up. <br>(Hearing this incident), Imam Sadeq (a.s.) laughed and asked, ‘<i>O Heshaam! Who taught you this?</i>’ <br>He answered, ‘This is what I have learnt from you and compiled.’<br>He (a.s.) remarked, ‘By Allah! This is written in the scriptures of Ibraheem and Moosa.’",

    "english": "Ali Ibn Ibraheem narrates from his father vide another person from Yunus Ibn Yaqoob who reports, “I was in the company of Imam Abu Abdillah (al-Sadeq a.s.) when a man from Syria entered and said, ‘I am a theologian, jurist and (acting on my) duties. I have come to debate with your companions.’ <br>Imam Abu Abdillah (a.s.) asked, ‘<i>Your theology is from the theology of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) or your own theology?</i>’<br>He replied, ‘It is a combination of the theology of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) and my own theology.’<br>Imam (a.s.) asked, ‘<i>Are you a partner of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.)?</i>’<br>He replied, ‘No.’<br>Imam (a.s.) inquired, ‘<i>Do you receive revelation from Allah – Mighty and Majesty be He – that informs you (of the unseen)?</i>’<br>Again he responded in the negative. <br>Imam (a.s.) questioned, ‘<i>Is your obedience obligatory like the obedience of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) was obligatory?</i>’<br>Yet again, he said no. <br>Imam Abu Abdillah (a.s.) turned to me and said, ‘<i>O Yunus Ibn Yaqoob! He has defeated himself even before the debate has commenced. O Yunus! Had you known to debate well, you would have debated with him.</i>’ <br>I said, ‘O how much I regret (my inability to debate)! May I be held your ransom! I heard you prohibiting from debating and saying, ‘Woe unto the people of theology! They say, ‘This can be criticized and this cannot be criticized. This can be rearranged and this cannot be rearranged. This can be understood and this cannot be understood.’<br>Imam Abu Abdillah (a.s.) explained, ‘<i>I had said that woe unto them if they forsake what I say and tread the path as per their whim.</i>’ Thereafter, he (a.s.) ordered me, ‘<i>Go to the door and whosoever you see of the debaters, bring him in.</i>’ <br>So I brought Humraan Ibn A’yan, who was a good debater, (Momin al-Taaq) al-Ahwal, who too was a good debater, Heshaam Ibn Saalem, who also was a good debater and Qais al-Maasir, who according to me was the best of them in debates as he had learnt the art of debating from Imam Ali Ibn al-Husain (a.s.). We all settled down as a gathering and Imam Abu Abdillah (a.s.), a few days before the commencement of Hajj, stay at the mount near the Holy Ka’bah, in a tent erected for him. <br>He (Yunus) says, ‘Imam Abu Abdillah (a.s.) stuck out his head from his tent, when he (a.s.) saw a camel ambling. He (a.s.) exclaimed, ‘<i>Heshaam! By the Lord of the Ka’bah!</i>’ <br>We thought it was Heshaam, a man from the progeny of Aqeel (Ibn Abi Talib), whom Imam (a.s.) loved a lot. <br>Heshaam Ibn al-Hakam, who was so young that his beard had just started to grow, entered. He was the youngest of us. <br>Imam Abu Abdillah (a.s.) made place for him and said, ‘<i>(He is) our helper with his heart, his tongue and his hands.</i>’ <br>Thereafter, Imam (a.s.) ordered, ‘<i>O Humraan! Debate with him (i.e. the Syrian).</i>’ Humraan debated with him and defeated him.<br>Imam (a.s.) said, ‘<i>O Taaqi! Debate with him.</i>’ He argued with him and overpowered him.<br>Imam (a.s.) commanded, ‘<i>O Heshaam Ibn Saalem! Debate with him.</i>’ Both conceded quickly. <br>Imam Abu Abdillah (a.s.) said to Qais al-Maasir, ‘<i>Debate with him.</i>’ When they were debating, Imam (a.s.) started laughing due to the plight of the Syrian inflicted by Qais.<br>Finally, Imam Abu Abdillah (a.s.) said to the Syrian, ‘<i>Debate with this boy (viz. Heshaam Ibn al-Hakam).</i>’<br>The Syrian agreed and said to Heshaam, ‘Young man, ask me about the Imamat of this man’ (indicating in a derogatory manner to Imam a.s.) due to which Heshaam became so angry that he was trembling with anger. <br>Heshaam asked, ‘O Syrian! Tell me, is your Lord more considerate towards His creatures or the creatures towards themselves?’<br>The Syrian replied, ‘Of course! My Lord is more considerate towards His creatures than the creatures are towards themselves.’<br>Heshaam: ‘What did He do to show His care towards His creatures?’<br>Syrian: ‘He established a proof and a guide for them so that they may not disperse or when they disagree, he (the guide) unites them, straightens their crookedness and informs them of their duties towards their Lord.’<br>Heshaam: ‘Who is this proof and guide?’<br>Syrian: ‘The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.).’<br>Heshaam: And who after the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.)?'<br>Syrian: The Book and the Sunnah<br>Heshaam: Are the Book and the Sunnah beneficial for us today in removing our differneces? <br>Syrian: Yes<br>Heshaam: Then why are we, you and me, disagreeing and you have come all the way from Syria, in our dispute with you? <br>Syrian was silent. <br>Imam Abu Abdillah (a.s.) asked the Syrian, ‘<i>Why are you not talking?</i>’ <br>The Syrian responded, ‘If I say we don’t disagree, I will be lying. If I say the Book and the Sunnah dispels our disagreements, I will nullify my own argument because each of them has several intepretations. If I say we disagree and both of us claim to be right, then the Book and the Sunnah do not benefit us but that there should be an argument in it in my favour against him.’<br>Imam Abu Abdillah (a.s.) told him, ‘<i>Ask him (viz. Heshaam). You will find him for a long time (a handful in answering you).</i>’<br>Syrian: O so and so! Who is more caring towards the creatures? Their Lord or they themselves?<br>Heshaam: Their Lord is more caring towards them than they are to themselves. <br>Syrian: So, has He appointed for them someone who will gather their words, straighten their crookedness and informs them of their right from their wrong? <br>Heshaam: During the time of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) or now? <br>Syrian: In the time of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.), it was the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) himself. But who is the divine proof today?<br>Heshaam: The one who is sitting here, to whom people set out and he informs us about the news of the skies and the earth, inheriting it from his father and grandfather. <br>Syrian: How can this be proved for me? <br>Heshaam: Ask him whatever you want. <br>Syrian: You have severed my excuses. I have no option but to ask. <br>Imam Abu Abdillah (a.s.) informed, ‘<i>O Syrian! I will inform you about your journey and the details of your path. It was such and such.</i>’<br>The Syrian said, ‘You have spoken the truth. I submit to Allah right now.’<br>Imam Abu Abdillah (a.s.) rectified him, ‘<i>Rather say, I believe in Allah right now. Islam is before Imaan. Inheritance and marriage is based on Islam while reward (in the hereafter) is based on Imaan.</i>’ <br>The Syrian accepted, ‘You have spoken the truth. Right now I testify that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) and that you are the successor of the successors….’",

      "In every era, falsehood manifests itself in a very systematic manner. It does not come naked and say I am falsehood so beware of me. Thus, in every era, falsehood is camouflaged and presents itself as truth. Even in the time of Sulaim it was difficult to decipher despite the presence of Ameerul Momineen (a.s.) himself.<br>In the above tradition, Ameerul Momineen (a.s.) has used the 59th verse of Surah Nisaa as an evidence for Imamate. The opponents interpret Ulil Amr as rulers even if he is a transgressor and sinner and consider him as the application of this verse, due to which his obedience becomes absolute like that of Allah and His Messenger (s.a.w.a.). When an ordinary person will not contradict his statement, then how will Allah do it? <br>For example, Allah the High says in the Holy Quran, “<b>O you who believe! Fasting has been made obligatory upon you</b>”. But the ruler of Tunisia, Habib Burqiba, prohibited fasting for government servants on duty. So, we should obey Allah and His Messenger (s.a.w.a.) or Habib Burqiba? <br>With the exception of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) and Ameerul Momineen (a.s.), all rulers throughout history who formed an apparent Islamic government, made laws in violation of the Shariah and were themselves non-infallible, rather transgressors. How can one obey Allah and His Messenger (s.a.w.a.) and the transgressor ruler at the same time? Such a stark contrast is against intellect as well as Shariah. Therefore, those in authority are in reality only those who don’t pass any judgment except in conformity with the judgment of Allah and His Messenger (s.a.w.a.). So, if we believe that the Ulil Amr are other than the fourteen infallible guides (a.s.), contradiction is bound to occur. <br>While, in the Holy Quran, contradiction is impossible. Hence, the problem lies with the interpretation of the opponents, which is wrong and erroneous."

This tahleel (saying there is no god but Allah) is not sufficient for a person to go to Paradise. Umar killed a person for drinking wine.

No learned person – regardless of his sect – will ever accept that a person like Saddam (may Allah curse him) will go to Paradise just because he has uttered that there is no god but Allah. Saddam himself will not accept such a logic otherwise he would not have killed so many of his rivals like Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr or waged a war against Iran as all of them were reciters of the kalemah.</p>"

      "<p>Here, there is one important point. One person is like another. Why should one person obey another? There should definitely be something in the obeyed one which the obeying one does not have. For example, when you have a toothache you go to a dentist. He tells you to open your mouth, you do. Whatever he orders you oblige. Why? He is a specialist in that field. Likewise, in religion, there should be someone who has knowledge from Allah so that his obedience is compulsory. When Allah appoints someone, He orders for his complete and absolute obedience. This appointment should be from the side of Allah. Just as in the case of the dentist, if he does not have a certificate and degree from the Medical Council, how can he practice his trade and why will anyone go to him? Whoever disobeys this divine appointee will die the death of a Jew or a Christian. Here, Jew or Christian are merely examples. It means that he dies the death of an infidel. <b>جحود</b> means to deny after knowing. </p><p>Another example: Government builds roads and highways between cities. It also makes some rules and regulations so that there is road discipline and speed on these roads. Whoever follows these rules and discipline will be saved. If somebody does not follow these rules, he will meet with an accident and perish. Both these consequences are logical and rational. Ships and birds also have paths charted out in oceans and air. They don’t sail or fly as they please. If they don’t follow the charted route, they will run into problems.</p>"

His example is like that of a sheep which has separated from its shepherd and its flock. Whole day it keeps wandering, coming and going, lost. When night descends, it sees a flock with its shepherd, comes to it and spends the night with it in its pen. When the shepherd drives its flock, it does not recognize its shepherd and its flock and hence, flees in confusion and seeking its shepherd and its flock. On departing, it sees another flock of cattle. It intends to go towards it and is about to reach it when its shepherd cries, ‘Go towards your flock. You are lost and confused. You are deviated from your shepherd and your flock’. So, it flees in panic and confused. It does not have any shepherd to guide it towards its pasture or return it. In the meantime, a wolf seizes this opportunity, kills it and devours it. O Muhammad! This is exactly the case of the one from this nation who does not have a just Imam from Allah. He gets up in the morning, all lost and confused. If he dies in this condition, dies the death of disbelief and hypocrisy. Know, O Muhammad, the Imams of truth and their followers are upon the religion of Allah till its end.</i>” ",

      "<p>In Aleppo (Halab), Syria, great scholars were found. Some of them were in the era of the infallible Imams (a.s.) and the other group was after their (a.s.) period. The narrator of this tradition was from the former group.</p><p>When you learn your religion from the Holy Quran, your religion will be with knowledge and strong. He is taking the religion from its pure source viz. the two heavy things. </p><p>Mountains don’t move easily. They are a symbol of firmness, strength and steadfastness. When one’s faith is taken from the Holy Quran and the holy Ahle Bait (a.s.), then the mountains can move but not the faith of this believer. Hujr Ibn Adi (r.a.) and his friends (r.a.) faced terrible torture from Moaviyah but they didn’t budge from their faith. </p><p>Then Imam (a.s.) proceeds to cite evidences of mastership from the Holy Quran. The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) has ordered for the mastership of Ameerul Momineen (a.s.). One should believe from the heart, not only apparently. If somebody does not believe from the heart, he is not a believer (as per the verse of Surah Nisaa). </p><p><u><b>Objection:</b></u> Is the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) mustajaab al-da’wah (i.e. one whose supplication is accepted) or not?</p><p><u><b>Answer:</b></u> It’s clear that he (s.a.w.a.) is so.</p><p> <u><b>Objection:</b></u> They object then this tradition is incorrect because many people abandoned him. But they were not abandoned. </p><p><u><b>Answer:</b></u> There are two answers for this:<br>1) The Holy Quran says, “<ar>قالَ قَدْ أُجيبَتْ دَعْوَتُكُما فَاسْتَقيما وَ لا تَتَّبِعانِ سَبيلَ الَّذينَ لا يَعْلَمُونَ</ar>” “He (Allah) said: Indeed, the supplication of you two has been accepted, so be firm and don’t follow the path of those who don’t know.” (Surah Yunus (10): Verse 89). But in the traditions, it has come that their supplication was accepted after forty years. <br><ar>ابْنُ اَبِي عُمَيْرٍ عَنْ هِشَامِ بْنِ سَالِمٍ عَنْ اَبِي عَبْدِ اللهِؑ قَالَ كَانَ بَيْنَ قَوْلِ اللهِ عَزَّ وَ جَلَّ قَدْ أُجِيبَتْ دَعْوَتُكُما وَ بَيْنَ اَخْذِ فِرْعَوْنَ اَرْبَعِينَ عَاماً</ar><br>(Kaafi, vol. 2, p. 489, H. 5). Is this verse fabricated? <br>2) Are materialistic matters more important than spiritual ones? Who is more successful; the one who eats well but does not pray or the one who eats simple bread but prays? A true believer, inwardly and outwardly, but poor is better than a rich but irreligious man. Is it not so? Who is the loser? Similarly, the Muslims were abandoned in spiritual matters and those of knowledge. If material belongings were so important, Allah would have given his most beloved creature (s.a.w.a.) all material pleasures.</p>"

      "<p>Allah is the All-Knowing Who knows what is good and what is bad for His creatures. He is also the Wise and Just Who puts everything in its place. If something is not fruitful for man, He will not make it obligatory. If something is not harmful, He will not prohibit it. He is not unjust to anyone even for an atom-weight. He is Needless and Self-sufficient. Therefore, when He orders His servants to establish prayers, He knows that prayers are good and beautiful for His servants. He is not in need of prayers that He ordered them for His benefit. He does not intend to trouble His servants because He is not unjust. Thus, everything that He makes obligatory is good and beautiful. When the goodness and beauty of a thing is intense, Allah makes it obligatory. When it is not so intense, He makes it recommended. For an obligatory act, there are levels and the same applies for recommended actions as well. When an action is neither good nor bad, neither beautiful nor ugly, He simply makes it permissible for the servants. When an act is ugly and bad but not extreme in its intensity, He makes it abominable and when it is extremely intense in its ugliness and evil, He makes it prohibited.</p><p>Why Khums is not mentioned in the above tradition? The reason is that Khums is an off-shoot of Zakaat. Just as he has not mentioned Umrah because Umrah is a supplementary for Hajj.</p><p>The fifth is the mastership of the Ahle Bait (peace be upon them). It is necessary that people should accept their mastership; they cannot afford to disobey or defy them or bear enmity against them. But the people did not pay heed to it. Although, the four without the fifth are incomplete. In other words, Allah will not accept these four without the fifth.</p><p>Is prayer more important or mastership of Ahle Bait (peace be upon them)?</p><p>No doubt, mastership is more important because without it prayers will not be accepted. The same applies for the other acts of worship. Moreover, it is the Imam (peace be upon him) who guides the people to the more correct way of performing all the acts of worship. But this by no means implies that a follower of Ahle Bait (peace be upon them) should take his prayer lightly. For, the Ahle Bait (peace be upon him) were an embodiment of divine worship and also exhorted their followers towards prayers saying that their intercession will not reach to those who take their prayers lightly.</p><p>Then why has Imam (peace be upon him) placed it after the four acts of worship?</p><p>Considering the understanding and comprehension levels of the people is a very important thing. Otherwise, people will wage a war against the Imam (peace be upon him). For example, there is a tradition in Bukhari, where the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) addressed Ayesha as follows:</p><p><b>يَا عَائِشَةُ، لَوْلاَ قَوْمُكِ حَدِيثٌ عَهْدُهُمْ، قَالَ ابْنُ الزُّبَيْرِ بِكُفْرٍ، لَنَقَضْتُ الْكَعْبَةَ فَجَعَلْتُ لَهَا بَابَيْنِ باب يَدْخُلُ النَّاسُ، وَبَابٌ يَخْرُجُونَ ‏ </b></p><p><i>“O Aisha! Had not your people been still close to the pre-Islamic period of ignorance (infidelity), I would have dismantled the Ka’bah and would have made two doors in it; one for entrance and the other for exit.</i>” (Bukhari, Kitab al-Ilm, Hadis 126)</p><p>The Kabah had two doors since its inception. But the pagans shut one door and kept only one door. The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) intended to restore it to its original divine state but he (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) feared that the people would not be able to digest this matter and it would lead to internal strife in the society.</p><p>Similarly, in the above narration, Imam Sajjad (peace be upon him) has kept the most important thing at the end of the duties. For, had he (peace be upon him) kept mastership ahead of prayers, some stupid people would have risen against him saying that he has disbelieved and would have gathered to kill him (peace be upon him).</p><p>Was it right for Imam Sajjad (peace be upon him) to present Islam in its distorted form (as in the above narration)?</p><p>The answer is NO. Then why he has done it in this narration? He has not presented it in its distorted form; actually, he (peace be upon him) has presented it in its actual form. Although he (peace be upon him) has mentioned mastership in the end, yet by mentioning that none of the acts will be accepted without mastership, he (peace be upon him) has clearly underlined its importance.</p><p>Hadis Saqlain is narrated by both the sects copiously. The chains are of various kinds and the sentences too. Scholars have written independent treatises on this tradition. We have presented here only one narration from one chain and left the others for the sake of brevity.</p>"

    "english": "Abaan Ibn Abi Ayyaash is the narrator of the book Sulaim Ibn Qais directly. He reports, “I went to Imam Sajjad (a.s.) and inquired about his opinion concerning this book. At that moment, Abu al-Tufail Aamir Ibn Waathelah – a companion of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and a very good companion of Ali (a.s.) – was sitting with him (a.s.). There, I also met Umar Ibn Abi Salamah, the son of Umm Salamah the wife of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). [Umm Salamah before her marriage to the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) was married to a man called Abu Salamah, from whom she had a son called Umar. This Umar was a nice man and was trained and brought up in the house of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.)].<br>I presented to him (a.s.) the Book of Sulaim. Imam (a.s.) said, “<i>Sulaim – may Allah have mercy on him –has spoken the truth.</i>”<br>I said, “May I be held your ransom! Some concepts in it straiten my heart. For, in it is the destruction of the nation of Muhamamd (s.a.w.a.) including the top Muhajireen, Ansar and the Taabeen except you Ahle Bait (a.s.) and your Shiites.”<br>Imam (a.s.) replied, “<i>O brother of Abd al-Qais! Have you not heard that the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) said, ‘Surely, the likeness of my Ahle Bait is like that of the Ark of Noah in his nation? Whoever boards it will be saved and whoever is left behind will be drowned and the likeness of the door of Hettah in the Bani Israel?</i>”<br>I replied in the affirmative.<br>He (a.s.) asked, “<i>Who has narrated to you?</i>”<br>I answered that I have heard it from more than hundred learned scholars.<br>He (a.s.) inquired again, “<i>Like whom?</i>” (i.e. give some examples)<br>I said, “I have heard it from Hubaish (or Hanash) Ibn al-Motamir and he mentioned that he had heard it from Abuzar while he was holding the latch of the door of the Kabah calling out loudly that he had heard it from the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.).”<br>Imam (a.s.) asked, “<i>And from who else?</i>”<br>I answered, “Al-Hasan Ibn Abi al-Hasan al-Basri who heard it from Abuzar and from Miqdad Ibn Aswad and Ali Ibn Abi Talib (a.s.).”<br>(Al-Hasan al-Basri was an erratic (<b>متقلبة</b>) personality. There is a personality that is unstable (قلقة) and there is an erratic one. The latter stems from natural short-coming (<b>قصور</b>) while the former is due to one’s weakness in faith (<b>تقصير</b>). The latter needs someone to guide him, otherwise he gets swayed by anyone. But the former is like a chameleon who changes his colour as per his convenience and material/worldly benefits. Al-Hasan al-Basri initially was among the supporters of Ali (a.s.) but later, became the backer of the Umayyads like Marwan and his governor Hajjaj Ibn Yusuf (l.a.). He openly voiced his support for both these tyrants. So much so that it is said, “But for the sword of Hajjaj and the tongue of al-Hasan al-Basri, the government of Marwan couldn’t have stabilized (<b>لو لا سيف الحجاج و لسان الحسن البصري لم يستقم الحكم الاموي المرواني</b>).” Ameerul Momineen (a.s.) had even called him as the Saamari of this nation. Al-Hasan al-Basri has narrated the above narration during his period in truth).<br>He (a.s.) asked, “<i>From who else?</i>”<br>I replied, “From Saeed Ibn al-Musayyeb, Alqamah Ibn Qais, Abu Zabyaan al-Janbi (al-Janb was an Arabian family) and Abd al-Rahman Ibn Abi Lailaa, all of whom reported that they heard from Abuzar.”<br>At this, Abu al-Tufail and Umar Ibn Abi Salamah intervened, “By Allah! We have also heard it from Abuzar and we have also heard it from Ali (a.s.), Miqdad and Salman.”<br>Thereafter, Umar Ibn Abi Salamah turned towards me and said, “I have heard it from the one who is superior to all of these. I heard it from the Messsenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.). I heard him (s.a.w.a.) when he said loudly and my heart retained it.”<br>Then Imam Ali Ibn al-Husain (a.s.) turned towards me and asked,<br>“<i>Is this narration alone not enough to pacify all that bothers you and is great in your heart than all these (other) narrations (recorded in the Book of Sulaim)? Fear Allah! O Brother of Abd al-Qais, if a matter is clear for you, accept it and if not, keep quiet, you will be safe and refer its knowledge to Allah because with you (is the license to leave the matter due to ignorance) is whatever is vaster than the heavens and the earth.</i>”",

Imam Mahdi (may Allah hasten his reappearance) is the last of them. Today, like in the times of previous Imams (peace be upon them), it is the duty of the people to contact their Imam (peace be upon him). For example, Ali (peace be upon him) did not contact Salman. The latter contacted Ali (peace be upon him) and obeyed his instructions. But today, it is he (a.t.f.s.) who visits whosoever he wishes. Thus, in reality, it is not occultation but manifestation with all its intensity. Imam (may Allah hasten his reappearance) will appear for the general masses at the time of reappearance. Thereafter, he (a.t.f.s.) will be martyred. Imam Husain (peace be upon him) will come instantly and the period of Raj’ah will start.</p>"

    "english": "In a lengthy tradition, Huzaifah reports: I saw the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) take Imam Husain (a.s.) in his arms and put him on his shoulder and supported him from his back while he (s.a.w.a.) was saying:<br>“<i>O people! Surely, he is from the perfection of my proof on the wretched ones after me, those who will abandon the mastership of Ali Ibn Abi Talib (a.s.). Beware! Those who abandon the mastership of Ali Ibn Abi Talib (a.s.) have gone out of religion. O people! This is Husain the son of Ali. He is the best of people vis-à-vis his grandfather and grandmother. His grandfather is the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) the leader of humanity and his grandmother is Khadijah the foremost in bringing faith in Allah and His Messenger. This is Husain, the best of people vis-à-vis his father and mother. His father is Ali Ibn Abi Talib, the successor of the Messenger of the Lord of the worlds, his minister and his cousin; and his mother is Fatemah the daughter of Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah. This is Husain, the best of people vis-à-vis his paternal uncle and paternal aunt. His paternal uncle is Jafar Ibn Abi Talib, the one adorned with wings with which he flies in Paradise as he wishes; and his paternal aunt is Umm Hani the daughter of Abu Talib. This is Husain, the best of people vis-à-vis his maternal uncle and maternal aunt. His maternal uncle is Qasim the son of Allah’s Messenger and his maternal aunt is Zainab the daughter of Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah.</i>”<br>Thereafter, he (s.a.w.a.) brought Husain (a.s.) down from his shoulder, who walked in front of him (s.a.w.a.). Then, he (s.a.w.a.) said,<br>“<i>And this is Husain. His grandfather is in paradise, his grandmother is in paradise, his father is in paradise, his mother is in paradise, his paternal uncle is in paradise, his paternal aunt is in paradise, his maternal uncle is in paradise and his maternal aunt is in paradise. He will be in paradise and so will be his brother.</i>”<br>Then, he (s.a.w.a.) declared,<br>“<i>O people! None from the progeny of past Prophets (a.s.) has been granted what Husain has been given, not even Yusuf Ibn Yaqub Ibn Is’haaq Ibn Ibraheem, the friend of Allah.</i>”<br>He (s.a.w.a.) concluded thus,<br>“<i>O people! Certainly, the grandfather of Husain is better than the grandfather of Yusuf. Thus, let not any of the affairs (of the time) make you sceptical that the excellence, the honour, the status and the mastership does not belong to anyone except the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.), his progeny and his Ahle Bait (a.s.). So, allow not the vanities destroy you.</i>”",

They would understand the concept very clearly but accept or decline as per their own choice and preferences. </p><p>مرق = to go out. مارق  means the one who has gone out of religion. Hence, the Kharejites have been given this title</p><p>As per the testimony of Huzaifah – who is universally accepted by all the Muslims – the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) has said that anyone who does not accept the mastership of Ali (a.s.) has gone out of religion. </p><p>Higher grades is one thing and having some peculiarities is another thing. Prophet Adam (a.s.) was the first human being on earth. This is one peculiarity. The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) was perhaps the billionth human being on earth. But who is superior? The answer is obvious. Thus, sometimes Allah places some characteristic in the inferior which is not found in the superior. Similarly, Imam Hasan (a.s.) and Imam Husain (a.s.) had special peculiarities which were not even found in the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) or Ameerul Momineen (a.s.). For example, the grandfather of Imam Husain (a.s.) was the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). Who was the grandfather of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.)? Abdul Muttalib. No doubt, he was a very great personality but can he be compared to the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.)? The same applied for all the relations mentioned in the aforementioned tradition. </p><p>Yusuf Ibn Yaqub Ibn Is’haaq Ibn Ibraheem (a.s.), they were four generations of Prophets (a.s.) and yet they are not superior to Imam Husain (a.s.). </p><p>Vanities here means false doubts which are cause of the destruction of a person’s belief. </p><p>Now, why did the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) introduce Imam Husain (a.s.) in such a manner? He (s.a.w.a.) was aware of the unseen. He (s.a.w.a.) knew that one day, half a century after his martyrdom, Yazeed the accursed will consider himself as superior to Imam Husain (a.s.) and demand allegiance from him (a.s.). Hence, we see that once Moaviyah asked Imam Husain (a.s.) in Madinah that is it right that you consider yourself as superior to my son Yazeed? </p><p>The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) – through this tradition – wanted to make it clear that there is absolutely no comparison between Imam Husain (a.s.) and Yazid. Imam Husain (a.s.) was belonging to such a lineage and was surrounded by such people that nobody could match him in this regard. Relatives are prior to any school in the training and development of an individual. When a person is surrounded by such people, greatness is inevitable. </p><p>On the other hand, Yazid the wretched had the worst of relatives and was surrounded by the most wretched of people. The father of Yazid was Moaviyah, his grandfather was Abu Sufyan and his grandmother was Hind. One couldn’t find a worse genealogy even if one tried hard!!</p>"

Is this possible? In this case, they will call us towards their religion and they will say that it (their religion) is superior to Islam.</i>” At this Mamoon interrupted, “Do you have any explanation contrary to what they are saying, O Aba al-Hasan?” He (a.s.) answered, “<i>Yes. Remembrance (<b>ذكر</b>) implies the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) and we are his family (<b>اهل</b>). This is explained in the Book of Allah – Mighty and Majestic be He – when He says in Surah Talaq</i><b> ‘So fear Allah, O people of intellect, those who believed; indeed Allah has sent upon you a remembrance, a messenger who recites for you the clear verses of Allah’.</b><i> Thus, remembrance is the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) and we are his family.</i>”",

      "<p>Almost all or at least most of the scholars of Ahl Tasannun suggest that people of remembrance (<b>اهل الذكر</b>) means people of the book (<b>اهل الكتاب</b>) viz. the Jews and the Christians. Here, Imam (a.s.) is using this verse as a proof of the superiority of the Ahle Bait (a.s.). Thus, they are the most superior and hence, it is the duty of the entire nation to submit to them. <br>“Glory be to Allah” in its secondary meaning is used for expressing amazement (<b>كلمة تعجب</b>). <br>If you ask the Jews and the Christians what is right and what is wrong? Islam or Judaism\\/Christianity? The answer is obvious. No wise man will ever accept such an interpretation. <br>In the verse of Surah Talaq, which Imam (a.s.) has quoted as evidence, remembrance does not mean the Holy Quran because here it also talks about the recitation of verses which the Book does not do, it is done by the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.).<br>Of course, even if we assume that remembrance means the Majestic Quran, then the Ahle Bait (a.s.) are the people of the Holy Quran. Nobody knows the Book of Allah like they do, as mentioned earlier. As tradition says,<b> فَقَالَ اَبُو جَعْفَرٍؑ وَيْحَكَ يَا قَتَادَةُ اِنَّمَا يَعْرِفُ الْقُرْآنَ مَنْ خُوطِبَ بِهِ </b>(Kafi, vol. 8, p. 311, H. 485) Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.) said, “<i>Woe unto you, O Qataadah! Only the addressee of the Quran knows it.</i>”<br>There is absolutely no disagreement between the Shia and Ahl Tasannun scholars that the Holy Quran is NOT an ordinary book which can be understood by all and sundry. It is loaded with concepts, codes, hidden meanings, knowledge of the unseen, etc. So a scholar, who is not connected to the knowledge of the unseen, even if he is an expert in Arabic literature, cannot comprehend the Holy Quran. Only he can understand it whom the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) has taught its esoteric meanings; and he has taught none except the Ahle Bait (a.s.).</p>"

Of course, Imam Hasan and Husain (a.s.) were the sons of Ali (a.s.) but here, Allah and His Messenger (s.a.w.a.) have made an exception that they are also called as the sons of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.). <br>There is a difference between guidance and piety. A person may be guided but may not be pious. Imams (a.s.) lead the people towards both. <br>Again, there is a difference between <b>هلك</b> and <b>هوي</b>. Halaka means destroyed and Hawaa means collapse. Destruction in this world, Barzakh and the hereafter. But collapse means punishment. Sometimes destruction may be without punishment. For example, a person meets with a car accident and is killed. But this is not punishment because it is not his fault. But hawaa means destruction with punishment. <br>When the storm of Prophet Noah (a.s.) came, only those who boarded the ark were saved and others were destroyed. Now, when they alighted from the ark, they married and had children. Hence, the entire human kind is the progeny of Adam and Noah, including tyrants like Namrood, Firaon, Yazid, Saddam, etc.</p>"

He (s.a.w.a.) replied, ‘On the condition that you will kill your father.’ The Bedouin replied in the affirmative and the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) accepted his allegiance that ‘you will kill your father’.

      "<p>The above tradition (as also the verse with the same words) clearly says that once a person accepts Islam, he should not take anybody as confidantes (ولائج) other than Allah, Messenger (s.a.w.a.) and Imam (a.s.). That is, whenever there is a contradiction between divine and devilish forces, a person should be very clear in his mind that he should opt for divine forces, notwithstanding his proximity or relation to the devilish forces. Hence, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) has gone for an extreme example of killing one’s father. <br>A person’s devotion and dedication to the cause of Imams (a.s.) should be like that of Malik Ashtar al-Nakhaee (r.a.). Ali (a.s.) said about him,<ar>لقد كان لي كما كنت للرسول صلى الله عليه و آله و سلم </ar>“He was unto me like I was to the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.).” (Rejaal Ibn Daawood, p. 283, No. 1232). This statement is sufficient to show his position and honour. On hearing the demise of Maalik, Ameerul Momineen (a.s.) recited the following elegy: <br><ar>رَحِمَ اللهُ مَالِكًا وَ مَا مَالِكٌ عَزَّ عَلَيَّ بِهِ هَالِكًا لَوْ كَانَ صَخْرًا لَكَانَ صَلْدًا وَ لَوْ كَانَ جَبَلًا لَكَانَ فِنْدًا وَ كَاَنَّهُ قُدَّ مِنِّي قَدًّا  </ar><br>“<i>If he was a boulder, he was solid; and if he was a mountain, he was its impregnable part. As if I was cut into strips from me.</i>” (Rejaal al-Kashi, p. 66)<br>Yet, Maalik was not among the closest companions (حواريون) of Ameerul Momineen (a.s.) but Muhammad Ibn Abi Bakr (a.r.) was amongst them.<br>The real reason is known to Allah the Omniscient but apparently, it refers to the level of submission. </p>"

He (a.s.) was the path of Allah; if anybody tread a path other than his will be destroyed. The same applied for all the Imams (a.s.), one after the other. Allah has made them the pillars of the earth that it should move due to them. They are the conveyed proofs for whoever is above the earth and inside its core. Ameerul Momineen (a.s.) declared, ‘I am the distributor of Paradise and Hell on behalf of Allah. I am the greatest point of distinction (between truth and falsehood). I am the owner of the staff and the branding iron. All the angels and the Holy Spirit acknowledged me like they acknowledged the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.).

I too was called, clothed and made to speak. I speak like he (s.a.w.a.) speaks. I have been characteristics which none before me has been given.

      "The above tradition and the previous traditions too show the knowledge of the unseen of the infallible Imams (a.s.). It should be borne in mind that this is by no means exaggeration in their (a.s.) position. Shias believe that all perfections of the Imams (a.s.) originally and essentially belong to Allah the Almighty. He grants perfections to whosoever He pleases. Hence, there is no question of polytheism (<i>shirk</i>). The Imams (a.s.) have themselves ordered their followers, “<i>Regard us as creatures (of Allah) (i.e. don’t attribute godhood to us) and then say whatever you want to about our merits.</i>” (Irshaad al-Quloob of al-Daylami (r.a.), vol. 2, p. 427; Behaar al-Anwaar, vol. 25, p. 289, H. 45). In some other narrations, it has come after this narration that Imam (a.s.) said, “<i>You will never reach us.</i>” There are several such traditions. For details, one can refer, Behaar al-Anwaar, vol. 25, Chapter 10 “<u>Rejection of exaggeration concerning the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and the Imams (a.s.), explanation of the meaning of delegation of affairs (<i>tafweez</i>) and what is NOT appropriate to attribute to them and what is appropriate.</u>” In this chapter, Allamah Majlisi (r.a.) has recorded more than twenty-five traditions on this subject, which can also be a fitting riposte to the exaggerators."

Hence, none should dare to take any of the titles of the Ahle Bait (a.s.). Take lesson, O people of wisdom!",
      "The mention of a sparrow and the ocean is to show the impossibility of comparison. Otherwise, the knowledge of Asif Ibn Barkhiya (a.s.) was even lesser than that of the sparrow when compared to the ocean of the knowledge of the Ahle Bait (a.s.).",
      "The last sentence of the aforementioned tradition truly confounds the intellect when it attempts to visualize this great aspect of their existence."

      "Among the Ahle Tasannun scholars, there were three brothers. All of them were learned and famous and each one of them had several books to his credit. They were all famous as Ibn Atheer al-Jazari and they were from the tribe of <u>Banu Bakr</u>. One of them had a book called as al-Nehaayah, which is a book on literature, comprising of general literary discussions and religious literary considerations. Now, let’s see how this writer tries to justify this tradition. He writes, “It is said that the meaning of this narration is that when Ali (a.s.) emerged to fight, people exclaimed, ‘There is no god but Allah, <u>how noble</u> is this youth! There is no god but Allah, <u>how knowledgeable</u> is this youth! There is no god but Allah, <u>how honorable</u> is this youth! There is no god but Allah, <u>how pious</u> is this youth! There is no god but Allah, <u>how courageous</u> is this youth! Since looking at Ali (a.s.) took the people towards monotheism, hence looking at his face was considered as worship.”<br>What he means to say that looking at Ali (a.s.) per se was not worship but since it led the people to monotheism, looking at him was worship.<br>Obviously, this justification is baseless and absurd. For, when Ali (a.s.) came out on the battlefield, his valor was apparent is obvious. But how his honor, knowledge, piety, etc. were known on the battlefield? For each trait there was a specific time and place!<br>In the above mentioned narration from Ayesha, when Ali (a.s.) came to Abu Bakr, the latter did not utter any statement of monotheism. Rather, he just kept staring at Ali (a.s.) and yet, justified his act by quoting the narration of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.). So, who understood the quote of the Prophet (s.a.w.a.) more, Abu Bakr or the Banu Bakr?<br>One can easily deduce that the aim of Ibn al-Atheer was to somehow reduce the significance of looking at Ali Ibn Abi Talib (a.s.) per se and connect the worship to statements of monotheism!!<br>Lastly, what about the other companions? Did looking at their faces lead the people into another direction instead of monotheism?<br>Allah has set a seal upon their hearts, and on their ears and on their eyes is a covering!"

The above question when compared to the issue of the mastership and superiority of the Ahle Bait (a.s.) is almost a non-issue. Hence, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.), with his perfect and complete wisdom, thought it prudent to answer the core issue rather than get entangled in peripheral matters.",

For, it is not permissible for a superior to ask an inferior to lead the prayers. But the opponents have recorded such narrations.",

In fact, when a narrator asked an infallible Imam (peace be on him) about the importance of love and hatred in religion, he (peace be on him) replied, ‘Is religion anything but love and hatred?’ (Tafseer al-Furaat, p. 428 under the verse of Surah al-Hujuraat)",
      "Does this and other such traditions give a license to a person to sin and do whatever he wants? Certainly not. True Islam (viz. Shiaism) is a religion based on wisdom and logic. Hence, when it talks about love, it means real love based on actions and not mere lip service. Imams (peace be on them) have declared in no uncertain terms, “Whoever is obedient to Allah, he is our follower and whoever is disobedient to Allah, he is our enemy.”",

      "Places, like all other things, vary in degrees vis-à-vis their importance and sanctity. For example, praying two units of prayers in Makkah al-Mukarramah has greater reward than the same act of worship in any other ordinary city of the world. Similarly, committing a prohibited act in a holy city like Madinah or Karbala is a greater sin than committing it in an ordinary city.",
      "The same applies for timings too. For example, committing adultery on Thursday evening has greater punishment than committing on any other night.",
      "<b><u>Importantly</u></b>, according to many traditions, the hallowed city of Karbala al-Muallaa bears more significance than the holy city of Makkah al-Mukarramah. Then why Imam Sajjad (peace be on him) has talked about Makkah being the holiest land? The reason is that Imams (peace be on them) used to talk to the people as per the levels of intellects and understanding. All things are not said to all people at all times. We have numerous traditions that the Prophets (peace be on them) used to speak to the people as per the levels of their intellects. Moreover, even we Shias have been ordered by the Imams (peace be on them) to talk to the people as per the levels of their intellects. If someone speaks everything he knows, then it is sufficient to prove his ignorance. (Ghurar al-Hikam, H. 4137). <u>Hence, it is possible that Imam (peace be on him) is comparing Makkah to other ordinary lands and not Karbala.</u>",
      "The likeness of the life of Prophet Nooh (peace be on him) is to show longevity. It should be noted that Imam (peace be on him) here has talked only about his life of propagation in his nation and not his actual life span which according to reliable traditions was approximately 2500 years."

      "Here, these two great teachers of humanity want to show that despite their high positions, they follow the etiquette prescribed by Allah the High. That is, when we enter into each other’s house, we must seek permission.",
      "Moreover, when the believers go for visitation (ziyaarat) of the infallible guides (peace be on them), before entering any shrine, they must recite the supplication of permission. One must never think that since the owner of the shrine is no longer in this material world, no permission is required. This is certainly not the case. All the personalities of the Ahle Bait (peace be on them) are alive even after departing from this material world.",
      "Those who were steadfast with Ali (peace be on him) after the martyrdom of the Holy Prophet (peace be on him and his progeny) and were not swayed by the incidents of Saqifah Bani Saaedah were like those who were with the Holy Prophet (peace be on him and his progeny). The converse also holds true. Of course, history is a witness that those who were steadfast were very few in number that they could be counted on fingers.",
      "Lastly and most importantly, the Messenger of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) is talking about Ali (peace be on him) being oppressed and repressed by his own nation and followers after his martyrdom. Ali is the one whose right was usurped, he was confined to his house, while he was seeing his inheritance being plundered. That is, the religion of Allah was being played with. Preposterous answers were given to questions raised about divine beliefs like monotheism. Quran was being whimsically interpreted. Its meanings and concepts were being distorted. The traditions (sunnah) of the Holy Prophet (peace be on him and his progeny) were being altered. Gradually, Islam was being counterfeited while the successor of the Messenger of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) was a silent spectator due to the latter’s will."

Thereafter, he will ask Allah – Mighty and Majestic be He – and call out to Him, saying, ‘O Lord! I ask You for the right of Muhammad and His Household that You have mercy on me’. Allah – Mighty be His Majesty – will reveal to Jibraeel (peace be on him), ‘Go to My servant and bring him out (from hell)’. Jibraeel (peace be on him) will ask, ‘How can I go down in the hell-fire?’ Allah – Blessed and High be He – will reply, ‘Indeed, I have ordered it (hell-fire) to be safe and cold for you’. Again, Jibraeel (peace be on him) will reason, ‘O Lord! But I don’t know his place (i.e. where is he in hell). ’ Allah will inform, ‘He is in a well of Sijjeen’. Thus, Jibraeel (peace be on him) will descend in the hell-fire and will find him tied on his face and will bring him out. He will stand in front of Allah – Mighty and Majestic be He. Allah – the High – will ask him, ‘O My servant! How long were you in fire crying out to me?’ He will respond, ‘O Lord! I cannot enumerate it.’ Allah – Mighty and Majestic be He – will tell him, ‘I swear by My Might and My Majesty! Had it not been for those with whose right you asked Me, I would have prolonged your disgrace in the Hell-fire. But I have made it obligatory on Myself that none will ask Me for the right of Muhammad and his Household but that I will forgive him for all the sins that he has committed against Me. And indeed, today I have forgiven you’. Thereafter, he will be ordered to go to Paradise’.</i>”",

      "From the mercy of Allah the High is that those who will go to Paradise will never come out of it but those who go to Hell have the option to come out of it, albeit with some terms and conditions",
      "The fire becoming cold and safe for Jibraeel (peace be on him) like it became for Prophet Ibrahim (peace be on him) proves that effect of anything does not belong to it essentially except with the permission of Allah the Almighty",
      "The essence of the narration is that if a person asks Allah the High for anything whether in this world or the Hereafter, his plea will be accepted immediately.",
      "<i>“…for all the sins that he has committed <b><u>against Me.</u></b>”</i> This phrase shows that only those sins that he has committed against Allah will be forgiven and not those in which he has trampled upon the rights of the people.",
      "Another important point in the narration is the selection of Hazrat Jibraeel (peace be on him) by Allah the High to perform this task of removing this sinner from the hell-fire. It should be noted that Hazrat Jibraeel (peace be on him) is from the most proximate angels of Allah. So the question arises as to why Allah has selected him for this task of bringing out a sinner from the hell-fire? Any other angel could have carried out this lowly task? The answer is simple: Since the sinner has invoked the Holy Prophet and His household (peace be on them all), this invocation carries tremendous significance in the eyes of the Creator. Hence, now this sinner and this task is no longer lowly. Rather, it has become extremely important in the eyes of Allah the Almighty."
